The moment ARC receives occupancy data, it activates the pre-heat function. It monitors the current outdoor conditions, the desired temperature and the current indoor temperature. From these values, it can calculate the optimal time to switch on the heating at a given moment based on the auto adaptive function. So you no longer have to keep an eye on whether it is 5 °C or -10 °C outside today and turn the heating on accordingly.
